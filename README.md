# 👋 Hey, I'm Raunak Singh

I'm a Fullstack Developer working in fintech, focused on building scalable systems with a strong emphasis on UI/UX, performance, and real-world usability. I enjoy owning features end-to-end — from design and prototyping to backend systems and infrastructure.

---

## 🚀 What I Work On
- Designing and building data-heavy dashboards with clear, usable UI
- Creating clean, intuitive UI/UX for internal tools and customer-facing products
- Converting design prototypes directly into production-ready frontend code
- Building backend APIs with pagination, filters, auth, and audit trails
- Developing performance-conscious frontend and backend systems
- Creating developer tools and browser extensions that solve real workflow problems

---

## 🎨 UI/UX & Product Design
- Hands-on experience with Figma, Canva, and Framer
- Design-first workflow: wireframes → high-fidelity designs → working prototypes
- Strong focus on usability, visual hierarchy, spacing, and interaction clarity
- Comfortable bridging the gap between design and engineering without handoff friction
- Believe UI is a feature, not a layer

---

## ⚙️ Backend & Data Systems
- Build and maintain APIs that power production-grade features
- Experience designing schemas and integrating multiple databases based on use-case
- Worked with:
  - PostgreSQL & MySQL for transactional systems
  - MongoDB for flexible document storage
  - Redis for caching and performance optimization
  - ClickHouse & BigQuery for analytics and large-scale data querying
- Strong understanding of trade-offs between consistency, performance, and scalability

---

## ⚡ Optimized Development
- Performance-aware frontend development (memoization, efficient rendering)
- Backend query optimization for large datasets
- Strategic use of Redis to reduce latency and system load
- Prefer simple, maintainable solutions over premature abstraction

---

## ☁️ Infrastructure & Personal Projects
- Building a personal cloud storage system using a spare laptop as a self-hosted server
- Designed as a private storage solution with ~1TB capacity
- Working on:
  - API-driven file upload and retrieval
  - Secure access patterns
  - Storage organization and scalability considerations
- Goal: develop a deeper understanding of infrastructure, storage systems, and backend reliability through hands-on experimentation

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Design:** Figma, Canva, Framer
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, D3.js, HTML, CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, ClickHouse, BigQuery
- **Caching:** Redis
- **DevOps & Infra:** Docker, Kubernetes (working knowledge), self-hosted systems
- **Tools:** Monaco Editor, GitHub Actions

---

## 🎯 Engineering Principles I Follow
- Design and engineering are not separate phases
- UI clarity matters as much as backend correctness
- Choose tools based on problem fit, not hype
- Performance issues are usually design issues
- Learning infrastructure makes you a better application developer
